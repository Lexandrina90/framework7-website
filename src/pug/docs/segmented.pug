    h2 Segmented Control
    p A segmented control is a linear set of two or more segments (buttons), each of which functions as a mutually exclusive button. Within the control, all buttons are equal in width. Segmented controls are often used to display different views (switch tabs).
    h3 Segmented Layout
    p Segmented control layout is pretty simple, just a `<div>` with a `segmented` class around buttons:
    :code
      <div class="segmented">
        <a class="button button-active">Tab 1</a>
        <a class="button">Tab 2</a>
      </div>
    p Segmented "strong" requires additional element to correctly indicate active state:
    :code
      <div class="segmented segmented-strong">
        <a class="button button-active">Tab 1</a>
        <a class="button">Tab 2</a>
        <!-- addition element required in segmented strong -->
        <span class="segmented-highlight"></span>
      </div>
    h3 Segmented Modifier Classes
    p As well as buttons, segmented also supports few additional classes for styling:
    table.props-table
      tbody
        tr
          td segmented-round
          td Rounded segmented
        tr
          td segmented-round-ios
          td Rounded segmented in iOS theme
        tr
          td segmented-round-md
          td Rounded segmented in MD theme
        tr
          td segmented-raised
          td Raised segmented
        tr
